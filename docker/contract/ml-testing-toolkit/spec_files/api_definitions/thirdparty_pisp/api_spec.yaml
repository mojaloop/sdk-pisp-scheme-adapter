      description: >
        This is a variant based on FSPIOP `PartyIdType` specification.

        Main difference being the CONSENT and THIRD_PARTY_LINK enums.


        Below are the allowed values for the enumeration.

        - MSISDN - An MSISDN (Mobile Station International Subscriber Directory

        Number, that is, the phone number) is used as reference to a
        participant.

        The MSISDN identifier should be in international format according to the

        [ITU-T E.164 standard](https://www.itu.int/rec/T-REC-E.164/en).

        Optionally, the MSISDN may be prefixed by a single plus sign, indicating
        the

        international prefix.

        - EMAIL - An email is used as reference to a

        participant. The format of the email should be according to the
        informational

        [RFC 3696](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3696).

        - PERSONAL_ID - A personal identifier is used as reference to a
        participant.

        Examples of personal identification are passport number, birth
        certificate

        number, and national registration number. The identifier number is added
        in

        the PartyIdentifier element. The personal identifier type is added in
        the

        PartySubIdOrType element.

        - BUSINESS - A specific Business (for example, an organization or a
        company)

        is used as reference to a participant. The BUSINESS identifier can be in
        any

        format. To make a transaction connected to a specific username or bill
        number

        in a Business, the PartySubIdOrType element should be used.

        - DEVICE - A specific device (for example, a POS or ATM) ID connected to
        a

        specific business or organization is used as reference to a Party.

        For referencing a specific device under a specific business or
        organization,

        use the PartySubIdOrType element.

        - ACCOUNT_ID - A bank account number or FSP account ID should be used as

        reference to a participant. The ACCOUNT_ID identifier can be in any
        format,

        as formats can greatly differ depending on country and FSP.

        - IBAN - A bank account number or FSP account ID is used as reference to
        a

        participant. The IBAN identifier can consist of up to 34 alphanumeric

        characters and should be entered without whitespace.

        - ALIAS An alias is used as reference to a participant. The alias should
        be

        created in the FSP as an alternative reference to an account owner.

        Another example of an alias is a username in the FSP system.

        The ALIAS identifier can be in any format. It is also possible to use
        the

        PartySubIdOrType element for identifying an account under an Alias
        defined

        by the PartyIdentifier.

        The `Content-Length` header field indicates the anticipated size of the
        payload body. Only sent if there is a body.


        **Note:** The API supports a maximum size of 5242880 bytes (5
        Megabytes).
    Content-Type:

    FSPIOP-Source:
      name: FSPIOP-Source
      in: header
      schema:
        type: string
      required: true
      description: >-
        The `FSPIOP-Source` header field is a non-HTTP standard field used by
        the API for identifying the sender of the HTTP request. The field should
        be set by the original sender of the request. Required for routing and
        signature verification (see header field `FSPIOP-Signature`).
    FSPIOP-Destination:
      name: FSPIOP-Destination
      in: header
      schema:
        type: string
      required: false
      description: >-
        The `FSPIOP-Destination` header field is a non-HTTP standard field used
        by the API for HTTP header based routing of requests and responses to
        the destination. The field must be set by the original sender of the
        request if the destination is known (valid for all services except GET
        /parties) so that any entities between the client and the server do not
        need to parse the payload for routing purposes. If the destination is
        not known (valid for service GET /parties), the field should be left
        empty.
    Accept:
      name: Accept
      in: header
      required: true
      schema:
        type: string
      description: >-
        The `Accept` header field indicates the version of the API the client
        would like the server to use.
    X-Forwarded-For:
      name: X-Forwarded-For
      in: header
      schema:
        type: string
      required: false
      description: >-
        The `X-Forwarded-For` header field is an unofficially accepted standard
        used for informational purposes of the originating client IP address, as
        a request might pass multiple proxies, firewalls, and so on. Multiple
        `X-Forwarded-For` values should be expected and supported by
        implementers of the API.


        **Note:** An alternative to `X-Forwarded-For` is defined in [RFC
        7239](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7239). However, to this point RFC
        7239 is less-used and supported than `X-Forwarded-For`.

        The `FSPIOP-URI` header field is a non-HTTP standard field used by the

        Signature
